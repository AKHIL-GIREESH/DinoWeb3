Integrating SDK into Unity can enhance the functionality and user experience of your game. In this blog, we'll walk through the steps I took to integrate a thirdweb SDK into a Unity project.

Step 1: Choose the SDK

The first step is to choose the web SDK that you want to integrate. The SDK I have chosen is ThirdWeb.

Step 2: Import the SDK into Unity

The next step is to import the SDK files into your Unity project. To do this, you need to create a new folder in your project's Assets directory and copy the SDK files into it. Make sure to include all the necessary files, including any plugins or dependencies that the SDK requires.

Step 3: Create a C# script to interface with the SDK

Once you have imported the SDK into your project, you need to create a C# script to interface with the SDK. This script will provide a bridge between Unity and the SDK, allowing you to access the SDK's functionality from within your game.

To create the script, you need to create a new C# file in your project's Assets/Scripts directory. In the file, you can define a class that interfaces with the SDK. 

Step 4: Add the SDK functionality to your game

With the interface script in place, you can now start using the SDK functionality in your game. To do this, you need to call the methods in your interface script from your game's code.
For Example - The main objective in our game was to reward the player a nft depending on the score the manage to get. It made the game really fun and gave the players something to look forward to.

Step 5: Test and Debug

Once you have added the SDK functionality to your game, you need to test and debug your integration. This involves testing all the features of the SDK to make sure they work as expected and debugging any issues that arise.

To test the integration, you can use Unity's built-in testing tools or run the game on a device. You should also check the SDK's documentation and forums for any known issues or workarounds.

Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this blog, you can successfully integrate thirdweb SDK into your Unity project and take advantage of its features. Remember to test and debug your integration thoroughly to ensure a smooth user experience.

For me the best way was to follow the steps given in the thirdweb official youtube channel.
